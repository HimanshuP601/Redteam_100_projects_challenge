# Redteam 100 Projects Challenge

I am doing the **Red Team 100 Projects Challenge** using the list from [kurogai/100-redteam-projects](https://github.com/kurogai/100-redteam-projects).  
I will work level by level, and mark each project when I complete it.

## ✅ How I’ll Use This

- I’ll start from **Level 1** and complete all projects in that level before moving to the next (if possible).
- I’ll mark **Yes** in the “Completed” column when a project is done.
- Each project will have its folder / source / documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is for learning and research. I will **not** use these projects for illegal or unethical activities.
